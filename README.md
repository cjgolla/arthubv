# arthubv

This is the original art website I was working on before deciding to refactor the front end using React. It is a fullstack app with a simple sign up/login functionality. Mongo is used as the main database, NodeJS for the backend and Javascript for the frontend. This will probably not work on your side because I made my site to be run locally on my PC, so this is just a showcase of what I have been working on for the past couple of months. A new and better app is in the works, which will utilize cloud storage to allow users to upload and view art that is stored non locally.
